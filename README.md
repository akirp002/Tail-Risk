# Tail-Risk

This is still Prelimenary Work....

We are trying to attempt to properly identify tail risk by extracting tail risk from GDP Data going back to 1885 for Germany, Japan, UK, USA, and France.


This code compares the Time Varying parameter model fit with the standard OLS.

This code uses a particle filter to identify the step function tail risk.
