# Tail-Risk

This is still Prelimenary Work....

We are trying to attempt to properly identify tail risk by extracting tail risk from GDP Data going back to 1885 for Germany, Japan, UK, USA, and France.


 Long Run GDP: This code compares the Time Varying parameter model fit with the standard OLS....Also uses a particle filter to identify the step function tail risk.
 PF SV: Full Empirical Model setup using both a Kalman Filter and Particle Filter for the Time Varing Regressions on Stock Returns.
